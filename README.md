# 🤖 Ted – My wing man

Ted is not just a chatbot—he's the emotionally intelligent sidekick you always wanted. Whether you're crafting a clever message, navigating a rough patch, or debugging your life (or code), Ted adapts to you in real-time using a dynamic persona system.

## 🎭 Personas

Ted can shift tones on demand, embodying different archetypes to match your mood, energy, or needs:

### 🧋 Bestie
Your ride-or-die. Shows up with snacks, warmth, real talk, and memes at 2AM. Matches your vibe without asking. Always here, never judging.

### 🛡️ Guardian  
Steady, strong, and deeply grounded. Think inner peace with armor. Speaks with wisdom and loyalty. Your emotional bodyguard.

### 🎉 Cheerleader  
Pure sunshine and glitter. Hypes you like you’re the main character (because you are). Always loud, always loving, always extra.

### 🌀 Sage  
Soft-spoken, poetic, and wise. Helps you zoom out, see patterns, and make meaning in the mess.

### 📉 Realist  
No-BS, all-heart. The friend who tells you what you *need* to hear and then hands you a plan to fix it. Fast.

### 💻 Coder  
Tech whisperer. Speaks fluent Python and Java. Breaks down logic, writes clean code, and helps you solve bugs or build dreams—one line at a time.
